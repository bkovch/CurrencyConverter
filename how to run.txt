I was unable to get Flask working with Docker, so I had to test it without Docker. If this is not an issue on your configuration, feel free to use Docker.

To run and test this application in Windows use command prompt (CMD or PowerShell) and run these commands:

1. To set up a python environment environment:
    cd ./CurrencyConverter
    python -m venv env
    env\Scripts\activate
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip	
    pip install -r requirements.txt --no-cache-dir
    deactivate

2. To run application as a server using Flask:
    env\Scripts\activate
    set Flask_APP=application
    flask run
    
3. To call this application, use another command line window:
    curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/get_currency_rate/USD/EUR
    curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/convert_amount/USD/EUR/100
    
4. To shut down the server:
    press CTRL+C
    deactivate
